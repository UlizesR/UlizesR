<h1 align="center"> Hello There, my name is Uli </h1>

- Currently a junior in college majoring in Computer Sciece and minoring in Mathematics
- Currently working on [MCL](https://github.com/UlizesR/MCL) which is a C library to allow for basic app development in macOS
- I like doing low level programming focusing a lot on graphics and embeded system programming.
- Tend to work on things that mostly focus on my interests or that seem like a cool project
