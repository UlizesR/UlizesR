<h1 align="center">👋 Hello There! I'm Uli</h1>

<p align="center">A junior in college pursuing a triple major in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics.</p>

### Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about exploring the intersections of computer science, mathematics, and physics through programming and visualization. 

### About Me
- 🏠 From Houston, Texas
- 🌱 Currently exploring low-level programming, quantum computing, and computer graphics.
- ✨ Passionate about creating visualizations for mathematical and physical concepts.
- 🎨 Enjoy sketching, 3D modeling, writing, and playing the piano in my spare time.

### Current Projects
- 🖥️ **MGL**: Developing a Raylib-based graphics library utilizing Apple's Metal API for high-performance rendering. Its a C library that wraps around Objective-C src code utilizing many of Apple's frameworks.
- 🔬 **Quantum Playground**: Experimenting with Quantum programming in Python and Q# to explore quantum algorithms and simulations, aiming to bridge the gap between theory and practical implementation.
- 🟣 [**Hopf Fibrations**](https://ulizesr-hopf-fibrations.vercel.app/): Working on a simple website to visualize the hopf mapping of $S^3 \rightarrow S^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$.

### Experience
- 📊 **GDSC**: Currently leading two developer teams as a tech lead in my Google Student Development Club. Our projects focus on game development using Unity game engine and motion capture software using Python and OpenCV. 
- 📚 **Research Assistant**: Currently a research assistant for my advisor, where I develop an interactive web app for water simulation of the local Mill Creek and study fish energetics to understand the effects of water flow on Salmonoid migration.
- 👨‍🏫 **Teacher Assistant**: Currently the TA for the Computer System Fundamentals (CS-210) class and formerly the TA for the Computational Physics (PHYS-300) class.
