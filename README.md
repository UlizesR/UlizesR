### About Me

I am fascinated by the intersection of Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics. My academic journey and projects often revolve around:

- **Computational Physics:** Exploring numerical simulations and models to understand physical phenomena.
- **Mathematics:** Delving into topics like differential geometry, topology, and manifolds.
- **Computer Graphics:** Creating visual representations of complex mathematical and physical concepts.
- **Low-level Programming:** Engaging in systems programming and hardware-related projects.

I enjoy working on projects that combine my interests, such as developing educational tools, simulations, and visualizations.
